### Prerequisites

- **Python:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Package Manager:** pip3
- **Git:** To clone the repository

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahadevmohan/Tweeter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Setup Azure OpenAI GPT Deployment API:
    - Create a Microsoft Azure account using your school email ID to get 100$ in free Azure credit (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students). If you are not a student, you will likely need to pay for the OpenAI GPT deployments.
    - In the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/), search for the Azure OpenAI icon and open it to create an OpenAI deployment with the default settings.
    - Click on your OpenAI deployment and then click on the `Open Azure AI Foundry Portal` button on that screen.
    - With the Azure AI Foundry Portal, navigate to the deployments section on the left hand side of the screen and deploy a base model gpt of `gpt-4-32k` or `gpt-35-turbo-16k`
    - Once deployed, use the Target URI and Key of the GPT deployment to populate your `.env` file in the folder you cloned the Tweeter repo to. Here is the skeleton of the .env file:
        ```
        ENDPOINT_URL=https://your-azure-openai-endpoint/
        AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-azure-openai-api-key
        DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment-name
        ```
